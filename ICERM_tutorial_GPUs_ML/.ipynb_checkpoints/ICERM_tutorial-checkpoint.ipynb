When training a neural network, it can be crucial to hand it data that is distilled to highlight the most pertinent information. A nice tool for doing this is Reduced Order Modeling. Reduced order modelling projects the information with lossless compression down to a lower dimensional space. We take our complex mode amplitude vectors containing 3843 modes and project this down to a real-valued space with 198 values. The neural network is then trained with inputs given by the $p$ and $e$ values and outputs given by the reduced order coefficients ($\\alpha_i$):\n",

    "Another equally important aspect to the maximization of efficiency is the proper use of the GPU memory structures. There are three main GPU memory structures to consider (there are a few more but they are for more specific uses). These are global memory, shared memory, and local memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Global memory** is contained on the host (or off-chip). Global memory is accessible by every block and thread in the entire grid. It contains many GBs of RAM. (The GPUs I use currently, which are Tesla V100s, have ~16GB. The new A100s have 40-80GB.) Because this memory is contained off-chip, it is slow to access. A key to accessing global memory efficiently is to use so-called \"memory coalescence.\" This effectively means that neighboring threads access neighboring addresses in memory. This allows the compiler to make up to 32 memory reads at the same time, rather than 32 separate memory reads. We will see this in a simple case below. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Local memory** is also contained on the host. Local memory consists of any arrays allocated within the kernel specific to each thread. Therefore, this memory is only accessible by the thread it is created on. Usually, around 512 KB are available for local memory for each thread. Since, this memory is off-chip, it is also slow to access. Local memory is, however, always accessed in a memory coalescing manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Shared memory** is different. Shared memory is located on-chip. It is, therefore, much faster to read from (~100x faster). Shared memory is accessible by all the threads on a given block. The catch is that only ~48 KB are available for shared memory. Therefore, leveraging shared memory effectively is key to the efficiency of GPU code. \n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, there are two main points to consider when beginning to program on GPUs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Layout your grid effectively for your given problem.\n",
    "* Use memory effectively: leverage the availability of shared memory and read from global memory in a coalescing fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some parting thoughts on GPUs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For maximal efficiency and stability, I usually code in C++/CUDA so that everything is precompiled and tested. \n",
    "* There are python libraries that leverage the power of GPUs. Check out numba, CuPy, PyTorch, Tensorflow, PyCUDA. \n",
    "* Lately, I have really focused on writing CPU/GPU agnostic code. This means that the source code is ~99% the same between the two. On the python side I usually sub in CuPy for Numpy. We will see some basic pointers on this below. In C++, I use short compiler directives to make minimal changes.\n",
    "* Generally speaking it is optimal to store all quantities in a 1 dimensional array when working with GPUs. Let's say you have a two dimensional array that has dimensions (dim1, dim2) and is referenced with (i, j). You can turn this into a 1D array that references each value with (i * dim2 + j). "
